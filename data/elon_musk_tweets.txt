@KimDotcom Fair point
@dogecoinww @MattWallace888 @CorinnaKopf You raise a good point haha

Pay by Bitcoin capability available outside US later this year
"Tesla is using only internal &amp; open source software &amp; operates Bitcoin nodes directly.

Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency."
You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin
@WholeMarsBlog @joeys_lady @DrSej Yup
@bindureddy And books haha
@bindureddy You can basically learn anything on YouTube/Reddit
RT @Fogdo : Thank you @Tesla for this helpful and cool feature :-) https://t.co/FLuY3yFdSL
@flcnhvy @arstechnica @SciGuySpace SpaceX will be landing Starships on Mars well before 2030. The really hard threshold is making Mars Base Alpha self-sustaining.

@lexfridman @AndrewYang !
@WholeMarsBlog I once did a road trip across most of US with 2 adults &amp; 5 kids in a Model S!
"@arstechnica @SciGuySpace They are aiming too low. 

Only rockets that are fully &amp; rapidly reusable will be competitive. 

Everything else will seem like a cloth biplane in the age of jets."
@WholeMarsBlog The new Plaid S is our best car ever. Will be first production car to achieve 0-60mph in under 2 secs &amp; it has four doors &amp; seats up to 7 people.
"@TheMarsSociety SpaceX is developing rockets needed to make life multiplanetary ‚Äî full &amp; rapid reusability at large scale. Even if SpaceX fails in that goal, the rockets will still be most advanced on Earth.

Starlink‚Äòs purpose is to provide Internet to the least served &amp; to pay for Mars."
@bluemoondance74 @NASASpaceflight Going well. Lot of work for an extra 20 secs of Isp!
@NASASpaceflight Hopefully will happen this decade
@newscientist True
@cleantechnica I am accumulating resources to help make life multiplanetary &amp; extend the light of consciousness to the stars
@CathieDWood When vast amounts of manufacturing are needed, as in robotaxis, this slows down rate of introduction, so maybe more like winner-takes-a-quarter. Still great.
@Swaggerheim @SciGuySpace Not trying to roast, just being as literal as possible

@AtomicsAstro @PPathole Yeah, but I‚Äôm English
@SciGuySpace Not quite how I would tell the story, but it‚Äôs probably worth a read
@PPathole This is important
@TrungTPhan Wow, hard to believe that was 17 years ago!

@WholeMarsBlog Given significant architectural changes, including fundamental improvements to pure vision, there is limited value to testing 8.x. Hoping to upload V9.0 &amp; button next month.
@SpacexVision An orbital propellant depot optimized for cryogenic storage probably makes sense long-term
